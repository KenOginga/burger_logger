# Description
This application is a resturant app that lets users input the name of the burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the application displays the burger on the left side of the page waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area has a "devour it" button. When the user cicks it, the burger will move on the right side of the page.
